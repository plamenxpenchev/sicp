;;Under applicative order evaluation, which is used by the interpreter
;;The arguments to the test procedure will be evaluated
;;Creating an infinite loop, because p points to p, etc.
;;Under normal order evaluation, we will expand the whole expression,
;;before attempting to replace the arguments with primitives.
;;Hence we will get (if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
